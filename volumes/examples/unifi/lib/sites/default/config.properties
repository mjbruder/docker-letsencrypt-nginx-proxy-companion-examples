## To change the default NTP server being used,
# config.ntp_server=0.ubnt.pool.ntp.org

## To enable/disable uapsd (some clients may or may not work with uapsd enabled),
# config.uapsd_enabled=false

## To enable/disable IGMP snooping (for multicast enhancement, default is enabled)
# config.igmpsnoop_enabled.[ssid]=false

## This is to facilitate portal redirect process, most users would never need to change this (note: this is deprecated since 3.2.10)
# config.redirect_via_host=www.ubnt.com

## This configuration sets the subnets that should be allowed to access for portal pages. For example, to set paypal express checkout. As paypal.com no longer uses static IP subnets, the current workaround is to enable all HTTPS traffic
# config.captive_portal_subnets=0.0.0.0/1 128.0.0.0/1

## To set whether to automatically authorize all guests when the controller is down. All guest isolation / policy is still enforced.
# config.selfrun_guest_mode=pass
# config.selfrun_guest_mode=off    # disable all the guest SSIDs when controller is not reachable

## To set minimum RSSI feature related parameters (see linked article for detailed explaination),
# config.minrssi.UAP_MAC.[ng|na]=[Minimum RSSI value].
## e.g. config.minrssi.24a43c02d824.ng=20

## To customize UAP provisioning (see linked article for detailed explanation),
# config.system_cfg.1= or config.system_cfg.UAP_USW_MAC.1= depending on whether you want to apply customizations site wide or to a specific device
## e.g. config.system_cfg.1=ebtables.1.cmd=-t nat -A PREROUTING --in-interface eth2 -d BGA -j DROP

## (v3.2.9+)  To change guest portal redirect behavior for HTTPS page
# config.redirect_https=true - guests will receive invalid cert error while doing https browsing
# config.redirect_https=false - This is the default behavior (3.2.10+ or 4.6.3+). Guests get timed out while trying https browsing
#
## (v4.6.3+)  To change guest portal behavior
# config.redirect_to_https=true - Guests will be redirected to HTTPS guest portal (8843)
# config.redirect_to_https=false - This is the default behavior. Guests will be redirected to HTTP guest portal (8880)

## (UAP-AC only) To disable broadcast and multicast filters,
# config.mcast_filter_enabled=false
## Note that by default DHCP and ARP will be passed through (NOT filtered). The filter only kicks in if there are too many broadcast/multicast traffic in the network (which affects performance). However, a more accurate solution to this kind problem is to refine subnet size.

## (UAP-AC only) Starting from v3.1.12+, TxBF (transmit beamforming) is OFF by default due to reported client-side issues. If enabling this feature is desired, we would suggest you update all clients drivers to the latest version first, and then add below config into config.properties file.
# config.system_cfg.1=radio.1.txbf=3
## On controller, to push this config to all APs within a site, add these into config.properties,
# config.system_cfg.1=sshd.1.status=enabled
# config.system_cfg.2=sshd.1.ifname=br0
# config.system_cfg.3=sshd.1.port=22
#
#
## The above will cause issues with USW SSH access, so if limiting AP SSHD to br0 add this for USW:
# config.system_cfg.USW_MAC.1=sshd.1.ifname=eth0
#
## Configurable Management Frame Rate (v4.6.3+)
#
## Set mgmt rate for wlan with <ssid>
# config.mgmt_rate.wlan.MySsid=54
# or
## Set mgmt rate for device with <mac> and radio <na|ng>
# config.mgmt_rate.UAP_MAC.na=36

## Configurable Broadcast and Multicast Rate (v4.6.3+)
## Set bcast/mcast rate for wlan with <ssid>
# config.mcast_rate.wlan.MySsid=54
# or
## Set bcast/mcast rate for device with <mac> and radio <na|ng>
# config.mcast_rate.24a43c02d824.na=36
